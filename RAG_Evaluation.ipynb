    "### What problem it solves ?\n",
    "* Limited knowledge in LLM.\n",
    "* Context  window problem (fixed number of tokens sent to the LLM)\n",

    "###### Retrieval Component\n",
    "* Context precision - It measures the signal-to-noise ratio of the retrieved context. This metric is computed using the question and the contexts\n",
    "* Context Recall - This metric states that if all the relevant information required to answer the question was retrieved. This metric is computed based on the ground_truth .\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Generator Component\n",
    "* Faithfulness - It measures the factual accuracy of the generated answer.The number of correct statements from the given contexts is divided by the total number of statements in the generated answer. This metric uses the question, contextsand the answer.\n",
    "* Answer relevancy - It measures how relevant the generated answer is to the question. This metric is computed using the question and the answer. For example, the answer “France is in western Europe.” to the question “Where is France and what is it’s capital?” would achieve a low answer relevancy because it only answers half of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All metrics are scaled to the range [0, 1], with higher values indicating a better performance.\n"
